<h1 class="connect"> Improving in the middle of a match</h1>
<p class="border"><img class="connect2" src="connect3_4.png"> 
  It is important to keep in the bottom your seven connections (if you place a piece to a connection your oppent blocks then you win with or with the block) especially if playing against an equally skilled player. 
  <br>
  This is because whoever goes first, the other will be the last to place down if the game ends in a tie. The number of slots going upwards is 6, which is an even number, meaning that if red E.g goes first then they'll be going first again for the second row.
  <br> 
  What you can do here is go in the middle for the first try and deflect any attempt the enemy makes at trying to rid your goal of obtaining control of central southern control. </p>

      Picture this, you and the opponent have build nuetrual space in the slides of the set, meaning no one has an advantage there because all atempts of making a connect 4 had been neutralised.
