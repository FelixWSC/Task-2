<p class="border">What are the best openings for Connect 4?</p>
<p class="border">When playing against a friend, sibling, or parent, it is important to note were you want to go and what you would do if your opponent went in an unexpected area. Connect 4 is a game that can be enjoyed by all age groups, but it can also be a game which requires one to focus his/her mind in the persuit of victory.</p>
      <p class="border">Starting in the middle is a brilliant first move. As even in chess, capturing the middle is usually vital for the success of the game, as you gain centre control and are able to move your piece freely and to the maximum of their abilities. 
        <br> But in connect four you capture the middle so that you can have positions that don't allow your pieces to capture enemy squares but to rather, allow yourself to capture space in the set for a connect 4. So going in the middle allows you to have control of more spaces and allows you to build up a seven stategy</p>
