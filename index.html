    <li>When starting the game, what does matter is where you decide to place your coin, not its colour</li>
    
    <li >Usually, it is up to you wether you play risky or not, as in the game there are positions that can be captured that ensure a swift victory but if the opponent sees and neutralises it, it will cost you your position</li>
    
    <li>And in connect 4, all that matters is position and critical thinking to defeat your opponent</li>

  <p>The seven formation looks something like the image on the left except the slit differnce of tacticle placement. Here yellow has won the game up using a diagonal connect 4 but instead a seven formation is here there is a horizontal and diagonal means of victory.</p>
   <p>This type of stategy is very commonly used and you yourself may have used it before without knowing. It basically looks like a a diagonal way of winning and along with a horizontal means incase the oppent blocks the diagonal or vice versa </p></ul>

  <p class="border"> Again, if you are playing against an equally skilled player the game with either end in a tie, or in skycrapper coins in the set.

  So what you do is count the neutral spaces in the set (those being places you can go that give you and the opponent no adavantage) count from ech row from whos turn it is then see once you finish going through thoughs spaces if your going to be forced into giving the oppent a connect 4, or if you give a forced connect 4.
  <br>
    <br>
  This isn't exactly luck but moreover is a whoever was able to get a 7 align in the bottom of the set first or a double horizontal and vertical means of victory. 
  <br>
  At first you are going to want to dominate your  competition but as you do so, they'll learn how you learn by playing with it, so don't immediately beat them and utterly destroy them, but rather have fun with you skills and slowly but surely deafeat them but make it seem as though it was luck or something like that.</p>
